      Need Help Verifying Manufactured Home and Owner Details?
    </h3>
    <p class="pt-3">
      The homeowner and location information in each of the following must align on:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-7 mb-0">
      (a) this application for Residential Exemption;
    </p>
    <p class="mb-0">
      (b) the current Manufactured Home Registry (MHR) registration; and,
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) the current land title as recorded in the British Columbia land title and survey system
      (<a href="https://ltsa.ca/">ltsa.ca</a>)(LTSA).
    </p>
    <p class="mt-7">
      The home location and homeowner(s) named in the Manufactured Home Registry match the home
      location and current ownership of the home on the Residential Exemption form.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-7 mb-0">
      You must have one of the following that shows the name and home location and at least
      one of the homeowners as also being an owner of the land where the home is located:
    </p>
    <p class="mb-0">
      - Land Title Search, dated within 30 days of today, or
    </p>
    <p>- evidence of a pending freehold transfer.</p>
    <p class="mt-7">
      Any differences must be resolved before you proceed. If the current MHR registration
      information is inaccurate, the register must be updated prior to proceeding with this application for
      Residential Exemption.
