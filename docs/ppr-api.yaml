  version: 1.0.0
  description: '<p>The Personal Property Registry (PPR) is a centralised, electronic register where details of security interests in personal property can be registered and searched. The PPR API provides a real-time, secure, direct link between your business systems and the PPR. With this API you can submit the following transactions:<ul><li>Search for Personal Property information</li><li>Register an interest or lien as a Financing Statement</li><li>Amend a Financing Statement</li><li>Renew a Financing Statement</li><li>Discharge a Financing Statement</li></ul></p><p>All requests must include a BC Registries issued API key.</p><p>All requests must include an Account ID.</p><p>Fee Information<br>Refer to the BC Registries Payment API to look up a PPR service fee by fee code.</p><p>Payment Information<br>When submitting a request for which there is a fee, the payment invoice ID and a reference to the payment receipt are returned in the response.</p><p>Searches<br>Executing a search is a two step process:<ol><li>Submit search query criteria which on success returns a set of results as summary information.</li><li>Submit selected summary results from the first step to obtain details on one or more Financing Statements.</li></ol>A fee is charged for every new search request - the first step.</p><p>Schema definition "string" type property lengths are published in a separate document named "ppr-api-property-lengths.pdf" on the Registries API web site.</p><p><b>NOTE: </b>With registration and search results it is possible to request a PDF report as a response. If the request header Accept value is application/pdf a report is returned in the response only if the immediate report generation is successful. If the report service fails to generate a report but the request is otherwise successful, a status code of 202 - Accepted is returned and the response payload is JSON. A subsequent GET is required to obtain the report.</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> a new Commercial Lien (CL) registration type replaces the Repairers Lien (RL) registration type. The business rules for creating and changing a CL type are similar to those of an SA but with no trust indenture. The transition date from RL to CL registrations, after which new RL registrations are no longer allowed, is published elsewhere by the Registry. After the CLA becomes law amendments, renewals, and discharges on an active RL base registration will change the type to CL.</p>'

      summary: Select Search Financing Statements
      description: '<p>As the second step in the search two-step process, choose from the summary information returned in the first step which Financing Statements to retrieve detailed information about. Only matchType and baseRegistrationNumber need to be provided to select a Financing Statement. The detail information includes all Change Statement, Amendment Statement, Renewal, and Discharge Statement information in reverse chronological order (most recent first). Exact match Financing Statements are automatically included in the results. If the request "selected" property is either absent or set to true the associated Financing Statement is included in the response.</p><p>If requesting a PDF and the number of Financing Statements is greater than 75, the request must include a callbackURL parameter, otherwise a 400 status is returned. If the request is accepted in this scenario the response will return a getReportURL value. When the report is available a notification will be sent to the callbackURL. The body of the notification is a single JSON property getReportURL with the same value as the original response. The caller can then use the GET /ppr/api/v1/search-results/{searchId} endpoint to fetch the PDF.</p><p>As of version 1.2.5, a callback URL will be used in a search results report request if it is submitted and the response JSON is over 220KB in size, which corresponds to a report of approximatedly 150 pages or more.</p><p>Only include a callbackURL in the request if one of the above conditions is true.</p><p><b>NOTE: </b> if the request header Accept value is application/pdf a report is returned in the response only if the immediate report generation is successful. If the report service fails to generate a report but the request is otherwise successful, a status code of 202 - Accepted is returned and the repsonse payload is JSON. A subsequent GET is required to obtain the report.</p>'
