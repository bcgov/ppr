      Help with Tax Certificate
    </h3>

    <p class="pt-3">
      The certificate must be issued from the tax authority with jurisdiction of the home, and must be valid for the
      period of the transport permit. It must state that all local taxes have been paid for the current tax year, or
      that a deposit has been paid against the current year's taxes, or that the tax collector has consented to the
      transport permit.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-7">
      The form of tax certificate may vary depending upon the tax authority. However, the tax certificate must
      state that:
    </p>
    <p class="ml-4 mb-0">
      a. all local taxes have been paid for the current tax year,
    </p>
    <p class="ml-4 mb-0">
      b. a deposit has been paid against the current year's taxes, or
    </p>
    <p class="ml-4 mb-0">
      c. the tax collector has consented to the transport permit.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-7">
      A valid tax certificate is required in all cases except in the scenarios described below:
    </p>

    <p class="mt-7 font-weight-bold">
      Scenario 1
    </p>
    <p>
      No tax certificate is required for moving the manufactured home to a different pad within the same park, or moving
      the manufactured home from locations on a manufacturer or dealer’s lot. To confirm this exemption applies check
      the ‘Certificate requirement waved’ below
    </p>

    <p class="mt-7 font-weight-bold">
      Scenario 2
    </p>
    <p>
      If the transport permit is requested by a landlord under MHA section 15(2)(b), then you must confirm consent from
      the taxing authority. To confirm you have received evidence of consent, check the ‘Certificate requirement waved’
      below
    </p>

    <p class="mt-7 font-weight-bold">
      Scenario 3
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are special circumstances for which registry staff deem it appropriate to waive the requirement for a tax
      certificate, then check the ‘Certificate requirement waved’ below.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-7">
      If there is no expiry date in the tax certificate, then enter the last day of the relevant tax year, e.g. 31 Dec
      20xx.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-7">
      If the tax notice for the current year has not yet been mailed to the owner, then the owner must pay a deposit
      against taxes owing in order to receive a tax certificate. The deposit must be an amount equal to the greater of
      $75 or the previous year's taxes less any home owner grant.
