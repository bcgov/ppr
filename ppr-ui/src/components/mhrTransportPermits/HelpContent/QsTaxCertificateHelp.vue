    <p class="ml-4 mb-0">
      b. a deposit has been paid against the current year's taxes, or
    </p>
    <p class="ml-4 mb-0">
      c. the tax collector has consented to the transport permit.
    </p>

      If there is no expiry date in the tax certificate, then enter the last day of the relevant tax year,
      e.g. 31 Dec 20xx.
