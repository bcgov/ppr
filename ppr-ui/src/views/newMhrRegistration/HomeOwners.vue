          Add a person or an organization as the owner of the home. You can add
          multiple owners to form joint tenancy or tenants in common ownership.
          Note: Tenants in common ownership requires more than one group of
          owners.

          <h4>Sole Ownership</h4>
          <p>
            This applies when the home is owned by a single individual or
            organization.
          </p>
          <h4>Joint Tenancy</h4>
          <p>
            This applies when the home is jointly owned by a number of individuals
            or organizations or some combination of the two.
          </p>
          <h4>Tenants in Common</h4>
          <p>
            This applies when the home is owned by a number of groups or
            individuals or organizations or some combination of the two (where a
            group could consist of a single owner) and each group of owners has
            the right to dispose of their share independent of the other owner
            groups and will be disposed of as part of the estate in the case of a
            death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each group will hold a certain share of the home. To record this it is
            necessary to express this as some number of a total number of equal
            shares. For example if the home is owned by two owner groups each of
            whom owns half of the home this can be seen as each group holding 1 of
            2 shares. If the home is owned by two groups but one holds two thirds
            and one holds the other third this can be expressed as the first
            holding 2 of 3 shares and the second holding 1 of 3 shares.
          </p>
          <p>
            The total number of shares in a home must be entered when the number
            of owner groups is entered. Then the number of shares each group owns
            can be entered when the details of each group are gathered.
          </p>

            If your tenancy structure cannot be accommodated by the online system
            please contact the Manufactured Home Registry.
